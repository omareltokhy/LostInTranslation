# Lost In Translation
Lost In Translation is a React framework specific frontend project for Noroff accelerate course studies.

# Assignment: Create a Lost In Translation Single Page Application using React

The app takes users username and routes the user to the translation view. If user is already in the database, user goes on to translation. If not, user gets added to database and then goes on to translations. The user then has a chance to write text (a-z) to input field, and get that text translated to sign language. The sign language images are provided by Noroff.
